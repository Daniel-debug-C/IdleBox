Game works, but there is one bad implemented thing and that is ( vertical grid layout ), because I didn't implemented it to be autonomous.

[Description]

The game where you collect boxes as currency.
Tap the box to make more boxes, then buy upgrades with those boxes, that make more boxes for you.

The game continues while game is off, so you can keep collecting more boxes!

How much can you collect?
